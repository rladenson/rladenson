### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Petal! 
---
I am a Software Engineer who really enjoys the nitty gritty work of tweaking the code and putting building blocks together to find solutions. In my own time, I work on projects for fun and to increase accessibility, specifically making shortcuts for things that were previously possible but very tedious. I want to bring my passion for problem solving to help make systems easier to use, more intuitive, and more accessible for end users.
